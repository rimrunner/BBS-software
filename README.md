A simple BBS software, used through telnet, C, socket API

Compile: no any special flags needed, just gcc
Usage: When the program is running use another terminal-emulator as a client by typing: telnet <computer's hostname> 3490
NOTE: userdata -file needs to be in the same folder

Status: Messaging and downloading are not implemented. The development has been halted. Other C-based network projects are currently planned instead. Commands which work are j (join conference), l (list conferences), q (quit), s (show userinfo). This project features nonethless communication between the server side program and a pure telnet client without any client application as well as the basic functioning of a BBS user database and command system.

Finnish language comments are programmer's personal notes and would be removed if this code was properly released
